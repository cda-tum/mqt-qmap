    Args:
        circ: The circuit to map.
        arch: The architecture to map to.
        calibration: The calibration to use.
        method: The mapping method to use. Either "heuristic" or "exact". Defaults to "heuristic".
        heuristic: The heuristic function to use for the routing search. Defaults to "gate_count_max_distance".
        initial_layout: The initial layout to use. Defaults to "dynamic".
        iterative_bidirectional_routing_passes: Number of iterative bidirectional routing passes to perform or None to disable. Defaults to None.
        layering: The layering strategy to use. Defaults to "individual_gates".
        automatic_layer_splits_node_limit: The number of expanded nodes after which to split a layer or None to disable automatic layer splitting. Defaults to 5000.
        early_termination: The early termination strategy to use, i.e. terminating the search after a goal node has been found, but before it is guarantueed to be optimal. Defaults to "none".
        early_termination_limit: The number of nodes (counted according to the early termination strategy) after which to terminate the search early. Defaults to 0.
        lookahead_heuristic: The heuristic function to use as a lookahead penalty during search or None to disable lookahead. Defaults to "gate_count_max_distance".
        lookaheads: The number of lookaheads to be used or None if no lookahead should be used. Defaults to 15.
        lookahead_factor: The rate at which the contribution of future layers to the lookahead decreases. Defaults to 0.5.
        encoding: The encoding to use for the AMO and exactly one constraints. Defaults to "naive".
        commander_grouping: The grouping strategy to use for the commander and bimander encoding. Defaults to "halves".
        swap_reduction: The swap reduction strategy to use. Defaults to "coupling_limit".
        swap_limit: Set a custom limit for max swaps per layer, for the increasing reduction strategy it sets the max swaps per layer. Defaults to 0.
        include_WCNF: Include WCNF file in the results. Defaults to False.
        use_subsets: Use qubit subsets, or consider all available physical qubits at once. Defaults to True.
        subgraph: List of qubits to consider for mapping (in exact mapper), if None all qubits are considered. Defaults to None.
        pre_mapping_optimizations: Run pre-mapping optimizations. Defaults to True.
        post_mapping_optimizations: Run post-mapping optimizations. Defaults to True.
        add_measurements_to_mapped_circuit: Whether to add measurements at the end of the mapped circuit. Defaults to True.
        add_barriers_between_layers: Whether to add barriers between layers to make them apparent after mapping. Defaults to False.
        verbose: Print more detailed information during the mapping process. Defaults to False.
        debug: Gather additional information during the mapping process (e.g. number of generated nodes, branching factors, ...). Defaults to False.
        visualizer: A SearchVisualizer object to log the search process to. Defaults to None.
