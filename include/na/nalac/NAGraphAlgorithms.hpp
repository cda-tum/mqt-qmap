   * any adjacent edge.
   * Additionally, the color must be greater than the maximum color of any
   * adjacent edge that does not contain the vertex v to ensure that the
   * following constraint is satisfied:
   * Let two nodes u and v be in the minimum maximal independent set and the
   * node w and w' both adjacent to u and v. The edge (u, w) has a smaller
   * coloring than the edge (w, v) iff the edge (u, w') has a smaller coloring
   * than the edge (w', v), e.g.
