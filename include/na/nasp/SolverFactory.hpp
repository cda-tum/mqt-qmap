   * entangling operation. This function generates this list from a given
   * QuantumComputation and a FullOpType that specifies the entangling

   * represented by the QuantumComputation to be of the following form:
   * First, all qubits are initialized in the |+> state by applying a Hadamard
   * gate to each qubit. Then, a set of entangling gates (CZ) is applied to the
   * qubits. Finally, hadamard gates are applied to some qubits. Unfortunately,
   * the function cannot deal with arbitrary quantum circuits as the NASolver
   * cannot do either.
