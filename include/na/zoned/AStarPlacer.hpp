   * @brief A* search algorithm for trees
   * @details A* is a graph traversal and path search algorithm that finds the
   * shortest path between a start node and a goal node. It evaluates nodes by
   * combining the cost to reach the node and the cost to get from the node to
   * the goal estimated by a heuristic function.
   * @par
   * This implementation of the A* search algorithm has some particularities:
   * - To increase performance for the special case of a tree, where there
   * cannot be any cycles and a node can only be reached by one path, it does
   * not keep visited nodes. This would require a hash set or similar data
   * structure to store visited nodes and check if a node has already been
   * visited. This check would take at least O(log(n)) time for a hash set and
   * is superfluous for trees.
   * - As a consequence of the first point, this implementation also does not
   * check whether a node is already in the open set. This would also require an
   * O(log(n)) check operation which is not necessary for trees as one path can
   * only reach a node.
   * @note This implementation of A* search can only handle trees and not
   * general graphs. This is because it does not keep track of visited nodes and
   * therefore cannot detect cycles. Also for DAGs it may expand nodes multiple
   * times when they can be reached by different paths from the start node.
   * @note @p getHeuristic must be admissible, meaning that it never
   * overestimates the cost to reach the goal from the current node calculated
   * by @p getCost for every edge on the path.
   * @note The calling program has to make sure that the pointers passed to this
   * function are valid and that the iterators are not invalidated during the
   * search, e.g., by calling one of the passed functions like @p getNeighbors.
   * @param start is a reference to the start node
   * @param getNeighbors is a function that returns the neighbors of a node as
   * references
   * @param isGoal is a function that returns true if a node is one of
