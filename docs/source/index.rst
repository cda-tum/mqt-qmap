Welcome to QMAP's documentation!
================================

QMAP is a tool for quantum circuit mapping developed as part of the *Munich Quantum Toolkit* (*MQT*) [#]_ by the `Chair for Design Automation <https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/>`_ at the `Technical University of Munich <https://www.tum.de>`_. It builds upon `our quantum functionality representation (QFR) <https://github.com/cda-tum/qfr>`_.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us via `quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de <mailto:quantum.cda@xcit.tum.de>`_ or by creating an issue on `GitHub <https://github.com/cda-tum/qmap/issues>`_.
