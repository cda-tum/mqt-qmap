============

*QMAP* is academic software. Thus, many of its built-in algorithms have been published as scientific papers.

If you use *QMAP* in your work, we would appreciate if you cited :cite:labelpar:`zulehnerEfficientMethodologyMapping2019` when using the heuristic mapper and :cite:labelpar:`willeMappingQuantumCircuits2019` when using the exact mapper.
Furthermore, if you use any of the particular algorithms such as

- the heuristic mapping scheme using teleportation :cite:labelpar:`hillmichExlpoitingQuantumTeleportation2021`
- the search space limitation techniques of the exact mapper (some of which are enabled per default) :cite:labelpar:`burgholzer2022limitingSearchSpace`

please consider citing their respective papers as well. A full list of related papers is given below.
